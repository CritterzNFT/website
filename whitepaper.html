      <div class="subheader-text">3.1 Mechanics to unlock</div>
      <div class="info-text">Critterz NFTs need to be staked to unlock certain unique mechanics. You can access the <a href="https://www.critterz.xyz/stake" class="whitepaper-link">Critterz dashboard</a> after connecting your wallet to interact with these mechanics. The main mechanisms that staking unlocks are:<br></div>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item">Access to the Critterz Minecraft world.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Generating $BLOCKs using in-game playtime.</li>
        <li class="list-item">Renting out unused staked Critterz to other players for a share of their $BLOCK generation.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="info-text">These mechanisms are only accessible when Critterz are staked. You will lose access to them if you unstake your Critterz. Luckily, we’ve created auto-staking mechanisms to save on gas fees for staking Critterz. Upon minting, users are given the option to either “Mint” or “Mint &amp; stake”. The “<strong>Mint &amp; stake</strong>” option will automatically mint and stake the Critterz in one transaction, which helps the users save on gas fees.  <br></div>
      <div class="info-text">Unique to this project, when users stake their Critterz, the Critterz isn&#x27;t just moved to the staking contract. Players who stake their Critterz are also provided with an sCritter (staked Critter) token. The sCritter token is used for many of the mechanics to be discussed in later sections. <br></div>

      <div class="subheader-text"><strong>4.1 $BLOCK token generation</strong></div>
      <div class="info-text">$BLOCK tokens are ERC20 tokens that are generated with in-game activity in Minecraft and staked Critterz. To achieve this, we had to build a custom oracle to compute $BLOCKs generated based on playtime and bridge onto the Ethereum blockchain without incurring high gas fees for the player. $BLOCK generation is influenced by two factors: play time and # of staked Critterz. <br></div>
      <div class="whole-wp-img-wrapper">

        </div>
        <div class="img-caption"><em>$BLOCK generation scales with play time and the number of Critterz staked.</em><br></div>
      </div>
      <div class="info-text">In this case, while owning multiple staked Critterz generates more $BLOCK tokens per minute played, the multiplier scales as a square root of staked Critterz. <strong>This helps level the playing field between players, no matter the number of staked Critterz owned.</strong> The equation is for $BLOCK generation is:<br></div>
      <div class="info-text equations">√((play time × staked Critterz) / 30) × 100<br></div>
      <div class="info-text">$BLOCK generation also scales as a square root of playtime. This is also done for balancing purposes between players to prevent extended game sessions from dominating $BLOCK accumulation. The playtime calculation is reset every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC. This means that for the same playtime, you’ll generate more $BLOCK by spreading out your playtime over multiple days than by concentrating it in one day.<br></div>
      <div class="subheader-text"><strong>4.2 $BLOCK claiming</strong></div>
      <div class="info-text">$BLOCK tokens are claimed on our <a href="#" class="whitepaper-link">$BLOCK claiming dashboard</a>. Under the hood, a query is sent to the oracle to get the amount of $BLOCKs claimable along with a signature. This information is then used to claim $BLOCKs from the contract.<br></div>

Upon joining the server, players are asked to type /verify in the chat and open the in-game link. The link will ask the player to connect to Metamask, after which their account will be connected.<br></div>
      <div class="info-text">Anyone can access the server, but <strong>only players with at least one staked (and verified) Critterz can access the main world </strong>to start generating $BLOCK with in-game time. All players are required to have a legitimate version of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition" class="whitepaper-link">Minecraft 1.18 Java Edition</a> to play. <br></div>

      <div class="info-text">By default, players can modify (build/destroy) any blocks on Plots of land that aren’t already claimed by another player in the main survival world. This means that you’ll be able to gather resources on the first unclaimed Plot you see. <br></div>

      <div class="info-text">Players without a staked Critter can still join the main Minecraft world. However, this comes with caveats in $BLOCK generation. The two alternative methods of joining without staked Critterz are:<br></div>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Purchasing a Plot</strong>: If you purchased a Plot from a secondary marketplace, you can join the world (how else would you see your Plot?). You’re also able to gather resources and play the game on any unclaimed Plots. However, without a staked Critter, you will not be able to generate $BLOCK tokens. We currently have future plans to add generation of $BLOCK tokens with staked Plots, but this is not yet implemented.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Renting a Critter</strong>: You can also join the server without your own staked Critter by renting a <em>staked Critter</em> (more on this mechanism in the Renting section) from a secondary marketplace. In this case, you will receive 2/3rds of the $BLOCKs generated, while the remaining 1/3 goes to the owner of the Staked Critter. You will have access to the rented Critter at a minimum of 7 days, after which the owner of the Critterz can revoke your access. </li>

      <div class="info-text">The project was inspired by other fully on-chain projects such as <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/anonymicenft" class="whitepaper-link">Anonymice</a>, <a href="https://etherorcs.com/" class="whitepaper-link">Ether Orcs</a>, <a href="https://www.furballs.com" class="whitepaper-link">Furballs</a>, and many others. In particular, we were very excited by the idea of in-game currency (ERC-20 tokens) generated from a decentralized source: this enabled a proper play-to-earn environment where the players can actually capture the upside of playing the game, unlike in traditional games, where most upside is only captured by the game developers through microtransactions. <br></div>
      <div class="info-text">Building on top of Anonymice, Ether Orcs, and Furballs, we wanted to make a gaming environment that players can fully immerse themselves in. Integrating Minecraft gameplay into the token generation was the first step to creating this experience. The goal is ultimately to create a metaversal experience in Minecraft: being able to live in the in-game universe and economy.  <br></div>
      <div class="info-text">Plot purchasing and ownership is also central to the play-to-earn model we developed: Critterz was made with the idea that players should own the parcels of land that they play on in multiplayer Minecraft: If players contribute to a world, then the player should have a direct stake for any improvements made to the world.<br></div>
